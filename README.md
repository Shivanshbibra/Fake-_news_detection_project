# Fake-_news_detection_project Using Machine Learning

Overview

This project is designed to detect fake news using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorization. It processes textual data, converts it into numerical form, and classifies news articles as Real or Fake.

Process

1. Cleans and preprocesses text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and applying stemming.
2. Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to transform text into a numerical format.
3. Splits data into training and testing sets.
4. Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify news articles.
5. Evaluates model performance and makes predictions.

Usage

1. Loading the dataset and preprocess the text.
2. Training the model using a labeled dataset.
3. Using the trained model to classify new articles as real or fake.

Example Output:
Prediction: Fake News

Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled real and fake news articles, sourced from Kaggle.
